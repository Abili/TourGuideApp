        Kampala is Uganda\'s national and commercial capital bordering
        Lake Victoria, Africa\'s largest lake. Hills covered with
        red-tile villas and trees surround an urban centre of contemporary
        skyscrapers. In this downtown area, the Uganda Museum explores
        the country\'s tribal heritage through an extensive
        collection of artefacts. On nearby Mengo Hill is Lubiri
        Palace, the former seat of the Buganda Kingdom
